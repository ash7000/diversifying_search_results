      "Some patients converted from ventricular fibrillation to organized rhythms by defibrillation-trained ambulance technicians (EMT-Ds) will refibrillate before hospital arrival. The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not (53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.\n",

      "There is controversy regarding the appropriate utilization of health care resources in the management of tricyclic antidepressant overdosage. Antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are routinely admitted to intensive care units, but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment. The authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ED with antidepressant overdose. They found that major manifestations of toxicity on ED evaluation (altered mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, and conduction defects) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course. Patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or QTc prolongation had no complications. No patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ED evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course. These data support the concept that proper ED evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation.\n",

      "As the use of helicopters for air transport of critically ill patients increases, the availability of monitoring devices for physiological parameters during flight becomes important. It has long been known that arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreases during unsupplemented, non-pressurized flight. In this study, the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen (cjO2) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers. Arterial PaO2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjO2 at ground level, 5,000 feet, and 10,000 feet altitude. Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis). The relationship between cjO2 and PaO2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147. The authors conclude that the transconjunctival O2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients. The results of study also support the use of supplemental oxygen in all patients subjected to helicopter transport.\n",

The change in glucose level for the total study group ranged from a low of 37 mg/dl to a high of 370 mg/dl, with a mean of 166 +/- 77 mg/dl. The mean for the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were 177 +/- 80 mg/dl and 154 +/- 75 mg/dl.

      "Boerhaave's syndrome represents a diagnostic dilemma for the emergency physician. The prognosis of this truly life-threatening emergency is darkened by any significant diagnostic delay. Unfortunately, classic or expected symptoms and signs are frequently absent at presentation, a circumstance that leads to frequent misdiagnosis. Two cases of Boerhaave's syndrome with \"atypical\" clinical presentations are reviewed and discussed. It is clear that Boerhaave's syndrome should always be suspected in the evaluation of any sudden chest, abdominal, or back pain associated with emesis. However, emphasis should be placed on the fact that this entity may occur without emesis. The chest radiograph is the most helpful diagnostic aid. Undoubtedly, maintenance of a high degree of suspicion by the emergency physician for Boerhaave's syndrome will lead consistently to earlier diagnosis, and subsequent aggressive intervention should result in considerable reduction in rates of both morbidity and mortality.\n",

      "Intraosseous infusions were widely used in pediatric patients during the 1930s and 1940s. Recent reports have re-introduced this concept and confirmed its safety and ready accessability for fluid and drug administration. However, these reports have not addressed the difficulties encountered during insertion of the intraosseous needle. Spinal needles, standard metal intravenous (IV) needles, and bone marrow biopsy needles have been suggested for intraosseous infusion. These needles were tested for ease of insertion on a pediatric cadaver leg. The site for needle placement was also evaluated during the study. It was found that the 13-gauge Kormed/Jamshidi disposable bone marrow/aspiration needle was the easiest to insert and did not plug with bone or tissue during insertion. An area proximal to the medial malleolus was found to provide a stable, relatively flat, and easily penetrable location for needle placement. This method was successfully utilized in ten pediatric and five adult patients. Intraosseous needle placement is a safe, rapid method to gain access to the venous circulation. By utilizing these techniques, a stable, usable fluid line can be established in even the most dehydrated pediatric patients.\n",

The patients fell asleep after injecting the liquid contents of Placydil capsules (ethchlorvynol) and awoke several hours later with severe dyspnea. Arterial blood gases demonstrated marked hypoxia. Chest radiographs revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar densities. The patients' symptoms and radiographic findings resolved after several days of supportive care. Changes in the lung caused by ethchlorvynol may be the result of direct effect of the drug on the lung.\n",

Three hours after admission for ingestion of at least 300 mg baclofen as a single dose, the patient became comatose and subsequently bradycardic, hypotensive, and hypothermic. A prompt increase in heart rate and blood pressure followed administration of 1 mg of atropine sulfate. Atropine appears to be useful in treating cases of baclofen overdose complicated by bradycardia and hypotension.\n",

There were 39 episodes in each treatment group. Patients were treated with intraperitoneal (IP) cephalothin (250 mg/L) and tobramycin (8 mg/L) in group 1, oral ofloxacin (400 mg loading followed by 300 mg daily) in group 2, and a combination of ofloxacin (400 mg followed by 300 mg daily) and rifampicin (300 mg daily). Treatment duration was 10 days. The average culture-positive rate was 75%. The overall cure rate was 80.6% with IP antibiotics, 78.4% with oral ofloxacin, and 81.1% with ofloxacin and rifampicin. After the exclusion of tunnel infections and episodes of peritonitis due to Pseudomonas and resistant organisms, the corresponding figures were 100%, 90.6%, and 93.7%, respectively. Side effects were minimal with IP treatment and with oral ofloxacin, but severe nausea and vomiting occurred in some cases with the combination of ofloxacin and rifampicin. It was concluded that oral ofloxacin is an acceptable first-line therapy for peritonitis in CAPD patients.',\n",
